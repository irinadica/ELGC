#Instructions for the application use.

You need VSCode, XCode or an iPhone, Android Studio emulator API 33 or an Android phone.

Open folder in vs and open terminal.

Write the command npm i in order to have all the dependencies.

To start the server, write the command npx expo start.

You will have a QR code that you can scan with your phone (download expo go app) or press i for iOS emulator or a for android emulator. 
The recommended emulator is the iOS as the looks are better than they are on Android.
